1. Creating a Responsive Service Page with Bootstrap
Objective:

The aim of this assignment is to apply Bootstrap layout concepts to create a responsive webpage that outlines the services offered by a fictional company, "Tech Solutions." The page should be navigable, and informative, and maintain a professional appearance across various devices.

Tech Solutions is looking to improve its online presence with a sleek service page that outlines what it offers in a clear and engaging way. The page needs to be responsive, adhering to mobile-first design principles, and should be accessible on all devices without compromising on usability or design.

Task 1: Design the Services Section Use the grid system to design a services section that showcases at least three services offered by Tech Solutions. Each service should have an icon/image, a title, and a short description.

Expected Outcome: A well-structured services section with equally spaced service cards that stack vertically on smaller screens and display in a row on larger screens.

Task 2: Create a Contact Form End with a contact form that uses Bootstrap form components. The form should include fields for the user's name, email, a selection of the service they are interested in, and a message box.

Expected Outcome: A responsive contact form that is well aligned and aesthetically pleasing, with intuitive input fields that provide a seamless user experience across all devices.

2. Exploring the Power of Bootstrap Grid Containers
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to solidify the students' understanding and practical skills in utilizing Bootstrap's grid system to create complex web layouts. The students will create a multi-section webpage that demonstrates the use of containers, rows, and columns within the Bootstrap framework.

Problem Statement:

Modern web design requires a deep understanding of responsive grid layouts to ensure content is displayed effectively across various devices. Students are tasked with constructing a webpage that features a variety of content sections, each with unique layout challenges that must be addressed using Bootstrapâ€™s grid containers.

Task 1: Header and Intro Section Develop a header with a full-width background image and an introductory text section that is centered both vertically and horizontally within the header.

Expected Outcome: A header section that stretches across the full width and height of the viewport with text content that remains centered on all screen sizes.

Task 2: Featurette Section Create a three-column section to showcase the company's key features. Each column should contain an icon/image, a heading, and a paragraph of text.

Expected Outcome: A responsive featurette section with columns that stack on small screens and align side by side on larger screens, with consistent spacing between them.

Task 3: About Section with Sidebar Design an 'About Us' section that includes a main content area and a sidebar. The main content should take up two-thirds of the width, while the sidebar occupies one-third.

Expected Outcome: An 'About Us' section that maintains a two-column layout on medium to large screens and collapses into a single column on smaller screens, ensuring readability and accessibility.

Task 4: Footer with Grid Layout Craft a footer that contains three equal-width columns for contact information, social media links, and a newsletter signup form.

Expected Outcome: A footer that is responsive, with columns that are evenly distributed on larger screens and stack vertically in an organized manner on smaller screens.
